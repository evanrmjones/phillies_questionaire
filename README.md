To find the qualifying offer, I downloaded the file of all salaries for 2016 and converted it to a csv file. Then, in excel I made all salaries into integers and "no salary data" values 0. I then downloaded it into a Python Ide and used a jupyter notebook to do analysis on the salaries. I then decided to use the Pandas library for Python to do my analysis on the data. First, I opened the data and put it into a DataFrame, a data type created by Pandas. I then solely selected the column that contained salary. Next, I dropped any values that were null. Then I put the data set into ascending order and used the head function to take the top 125 salaries. I then used the Pandas mean operation to find the value of the qualifying offer.
